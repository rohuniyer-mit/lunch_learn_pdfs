       "'6    Background  Globally, in 2019, there are 272 million international migrants (UN-DESA, 2019). In 2018 the ILO  estimated that there were 164 million international migrant workers (ILO, 2018a).1 Migrants  who are fully integrated into the labour market can boost the income per capita of recipient  economies by providing the labour and skills needed in critical occupations and sectors. Upon  their return home, migrants at all skill levels also have the potential to make a positive  contribution to economic development through financial investments, as well as human and  social capital acquired abroad, such as new skills, ideas and know-how (ILO, 2017a).  ILO evidence convincingly demonstrates the positive impact of recognition of skills and  qualifications to address various labour market challenges and to bring substantial benefits for  individuals, employers and national economies (Braňka, 2016).2 This is one of the primary  reasons why countries are making significant efforts to improve their skills recognition tools  and systems.  The importance of skills recognition for migrant workers is stipulated in the ILO’s Human  Resources Development Recommendation, 2004 (No. 195), Article 12: “Special provisions  should be designed to ensure recognition and certification of skills and qualifications for  migrant workers.”  The importance of skill recognition for migrant and refugee workers was also acknowledged  by ILO member States at the 2017 International Labour Conference, with the adoption of the  Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience Recommendation, 2017 (No. 205),  which states:  Members should include refugees in the actions taken with respect to employment,  training and labour market access, as appropriate, and in particular:  (c)  facilitate the recognition, certification, accreditation and use of skills and  qualifications of refugees through appropriate mechanisms, and provide access to  tailored training and retraining opportunities, including intensive language training;    1 The estimate is based on the UN-DESA 2017 data, reporting 258 million international migrants  globally.  2 Based on a literature review and case studies covering 78 recognition systems.
